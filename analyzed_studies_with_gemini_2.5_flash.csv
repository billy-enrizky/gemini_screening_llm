"{'title': 'Surface Engineering for Cell-Based Therapies: Techniques for Manipulating Mammalian Cell Surfaces', 'abstract': 'The introduction of cell-based therapies has provided new and unique strategies to treat many diseases and disorders including the recent approval of CAR-T cell therapy for the leukemia. Cell surface engineering is a methodology in which the cell surface is tailored to modulate cellular function and interactions. In addition to genetic engineering of cell surface proteins, a wide array of robust, innovative and elegant approaches have been developed to selectively target the cell surface. In this review, we will introduce the leading strategies currently used in cell surface engineering including broadly reactive chemical ligations and physical associations as well as more controlled approaches as demonstrated in genetic, enzymatic and metabolic engineering. Prominent applications of these strategies for cell-based therapies will be highlighted including targeted cell death, control over stem cell fate, immunoevasion, blood transfusion and the delivery of cells to target tissues. Advances will be focused specifically on cells which are the most promising in generating cell-based therapeutics including red blood cells, white blood cells (lymphocytes, macrophages), stem cells (multipotent and pluripotent), islet cells, cancer cells, and endothelial cells.'}","{'include_criteria_met': ['English language', 'Relevant study type', 'Effects on RBC properties/function'], 'exclude_criteria_met': ['No liposome-RBC interaction implications'], 'decision': 'exclude', 'reasoning_summary': ['The paper is in English language, which meets an inclusion criterion.', ""The abstract states, 'In this review, we will introduce...', indicating it is a review article, which is a relevant study type, meeting an inclusion criterion."", ""The abstract mentions 'red blood cells' as one of the cell types of focus for cell surface engineering, which aims to 'modulate cellular function and interactions'.

For an improved delivery of MTX, several pathophysiological features such as angiogenesis, enhanced permeability and retention effects, acidosis, and expression of specific antigens and receptors can be used either as targets or as tools for drug delivery. METHODS: There are many novel delivery systems developed to improve the pitfalls of MTX therapy ranged from polymeric conjugates such as human serum albumin, liposomes, microspheres, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, in situ forming hydrogels, carrier erythrocyte, and nanotechnology-based vehicles such as carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanoparticles, and gold nanoparticles. Some are further modified with targeting ligands for active targeting purposes. RESULTS: Such delivery systems provide prolonged plasma profile, enhanced and specific activity in vitro and in vivo in animal models. Nevertheless, more complementary studies are needed before they can be applied in human.

"{'title': 'Malaria parasites release vesicle subpopulations with signatures of different destinations', 'abstract': 'Malaria is the most serious mosquito-borne parasitic disease, caused mainly by the intracellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite invades human red blood cells and releases extracellular vesicles (EVs) to alter its host responses. It becomes clear that EVs are generally composed of sub-populations. Seeking to identify EV subpopulations, we subject malaria-derived EVs to size-separation analysis, using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation. Multi-technique analysis reveals surprising characteristics: we identify two distinct EV subpopulations differing in size and protein content. Small EVs are enriched in complement-system proteins and large EVs in proteasome subunits. We then measure the membrane fusion abilities of each subpopulation with three types of host cellular membranes: plasma, late and early endosome. Remarkably, small EVs fuse to early endosome liposomes at significantly greater levels than large EVs. Atomic force microscope imaging combined with machine-learning methods further emphasizes the difference in biophysical properties between the two subpopulations. These results shed light on the sophisticated mechanism by which malaria parasites utilize EV subpopulations as a communication tool to target different cellular destinations or host systems.'}","{'include_criteria_met': ['English language'], 'exclude_criteria_met': ['No liposome-RBC interaction implications'], 'decision': 'exclude', 'reasoning_summary': [""The paper is written in English, satisfying the 'English language' inclusion criterion."", ""Next, I assessed the exclusion criteria.

Large unilamellar vesicles composed of the zwitterionic phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine or the anionic phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol, or a binary mixture of the two, with or without cholesterol, were used to mimic the lipid compositions of the outer monolayers of the lipid bilayers of mammalian and bacterial membranes, respectively. Dynamic light scattering results suggest the absence of major alterations in vesicle size or appreciable vesicle fusion upon the binding of GS to the lipid vesicles under our experimental conditions. The binding isotherms can be reasonably well described by a one-site binding model. GS is found to bind with higher affinity to anionic phosphatidylglycerol than to zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine vesicles, indicating that electrostatic interactions in the former system facilitate peptide binding. However, the presence of cholesterol reduced binding only slightly, indicating that the binding of GS is not highly sensitive to the order of the phospholipid bilayer system. Similarly, the measured positive endothermic binding enthalpy (DeltaH) varies only modestly (2.6 to 4.4 kcal/mol), and the negative free energy of binding (DeltaG) also remains relatively constant (-10.9 to -12.1 kcal/mol). The relatively large but invariant positive binding entropy, reflected in relatively large TDeltaS values (13.4 to 16.4 kcal/mol), indicates that GS binding to phospholipid bilayers is primarily entropy driven. Finally, the relative binding affinities of GS for various phospholipid vesicles correlate relatively well with the relative lipid specificity for GS interactions with bacterial and erythrocyte membranes observed in vivo.'}","{'include_criteria_met': ['English language', 'Liposome/RBC properties with interaction implications'], 'exclude_criteria_met': [], 'decision': 'include', 'reasoning_summary': ['First, I assessed the exclusion criteria:', ""- 'No liposome-RBC interaction implications': The abstract explicitly states that the findings from the vesicle (liposome) studies 'correlate relatively well with the relative lipid specificity for GS interactions with bacterial and erythrocyte membranes observed in vivo'.

"{'title': 'Application of liposomes to improve the hypothermic storage of red blood cells', 'abstract': ""Introduction: There is an urgent need for the development of improved red blood cell (RBC) biopreservation techniques. Currently, use of additive solutions allows RBC hypothermic storage (2-6°C) for up to 42 days. The quality of the RBCs, however, continuously decreases during hypothermic storage. Transfusion of hypothermically stored RBCs has been associated with proinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, an increased length of stay in the hospital, and ultimately, increased morbidity and mortality in transfused patients. Cell membranes are one of the primary sites of injury during hypothermic storage. Cold storage of RBCs leads to a cascade of damaging events including phase changes and phase separation of lipids, lipid loss through microvesiculation, and ultimately, hemolysis. Our study investigates whether small unilamellar liposomes (100-200 nm) composed of specific natural phospholipids stabilize RBCs during hypothermic storage. Methods: A variety of liposomes composed of different types of saturated and unsaturated lipids (dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)) have been incubated with RBCs to investigate the effect of liposomes on RBC membranes and vice versa that of RBCs on liposomal membranes. FTIR-Spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used to study the interaction between liposomes and RBCs. The effect of various liposome compositions on RBC deformability and hemolysis during hypothermic storage was investigated using ektacytometry and spectrophotometric Drabkin's analysis. Results: FTIR and MALDI-TOF analysis showed that liposomes composed of DOPC or DMPC exhibited signs of lipid and cholesterol transfer to RBCs, whereas DPPC lipids did not. FTIR analysis showed that the Tm of DOPC liposomes shifted to higher temperatures after incubation (T 10°C). The Tm of DMPC increased after incubation, whereas the Tm of DPPC lipsomes was not affected after incubation with RBCs. FTIR analysis on ghosts prepared from liposome treated RBCs revealed that liposomes composed of unsaturated lipids have a fluidizing effect on RBC membranes. RBC deformability was impaired during hypothermic storage duration in all cases, however in DPPC-liposome treated RBCs this impairment was slightly reversed. In addition, treatment and storage of RBCs with DPPC liposomes depressed hemolysis as compared to untreated RBCs stored under the same conditions. In contrast, RBCs stored with liposomes composed of DOPC and DMPC lipids showed increased levels of hemolysis and a decreased ability to deform. Conclusions: The data indicate transfer of lipid components between RBCs and liposomes during incubation. In addition, exposure to liposomes improved the deformability of hypothermically stored RBC. The mechanism by which liposomes confer protection to RBCs is currently under investigation. The findings of this study suggest that liposomes composed of long-chain saturated phospholipids may confer protection to RBC membranes during hypothermic storage.""}","{'include_criteria_met': ['English language', 'Effects on RBC properties/function', 'Liposome-RBC interaction', 'Relevant study type', 'Liposome/RBC properties with interaction implications', 'Applications of liposome-RBC interactions'], 'exclude_criteria_met': [], 'decision': 'include', 'reasoning_summary': ['First, I assessed the exclusion criteria:', ""- 'No liposome-RBC interaction implications': This criterion is NOT met for exclusion.
